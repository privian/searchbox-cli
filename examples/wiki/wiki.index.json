A handful of engineering prototypes for the MJPEG daughterboard exist, but none actually function.\n</p><p>A stripped down Mach kernel was used as the operating system for the card.

This led to complex programming even for simple projects. An attempt to address this with an object oriented programming model was made in the mid-1980s with Sun's NeWS windowing system, but the combination of a complex application programming interface (API) and generally poor performance led to little real-world use and the system was eventually abandoned.\n</p>","OpenStep#firstHeading"],[660,"Interface Builder","<p>Interface Builder is a software development application for Apple's macOS operating system.
